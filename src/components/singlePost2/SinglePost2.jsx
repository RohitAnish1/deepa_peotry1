            It was good that you came
When I had such a need for you!
This time I got ready to learn
The lessons only you could teach.
How could I get so used to you
Blocking air to breathe,to speak!
You were so used to victory
And always saw birds form V in sky.
When we had our last supper
How much you had hollowed me!
Little by little I kept on trying
To mend the tatters one by one.
I knew not how much you had sinned
I never got sight of your chargesheet.
But always thought how pride matched you so well 
You do know how to best dress guilt!
You slowly ate with knife and fork
Delving into senses and taste
Sashaying tongue and twirling it
As luxuriously as you hurl pain!
You found me a bit too raw
But it was verdant love I was so full of!
I tried digging so much in
To make some space to seal you in.
What a dizzying world around me
I prayed that you would close your mouth.
What an imprint sorrow leaves on you
Three worlds can now scarce fill you!
Can I wash those hands that touched you
And forget that  I had ever known you!
