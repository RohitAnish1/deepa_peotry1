    <p>It was good that you came</p>
    <p>When I had such a need for you!</p>
    <p>This time I got ready to learn</p>
    <p>The lessons only you could teach.</p>
    <p>How could I get so used to you</p>
    <p>Blocking air to breathe, to speak!</p>
    <p>You were so used to victory</p>
    <p>And always saw birds form V in sky.</p>
    <p>When we had our last supper</p>
    <p>How much you had hollowed me!</p>
    <p>Little by little I kept on trying</p>
    <p>To mend the tatters one by one.</p>
    <p>I knew not how much you had sinned</p>
    <p>I never got sight of your chargesheet.</p>
    <p>But always thought how pride matched you so well</p>
    <p>You do know how to best dress guilt!</p>
    <p>You slowly ate with knife and fork</p>
    <p>Delving into senses and taste</p>
    <p>Sashaying tongue and twirling it</p>
    <p>As luxuriously as you hurl pain!</p>
    <p>You found me a bit too raw</p>
    <p>But it was verdant love I was so full of!</p>
    <p>I tried digging so much in</p>
    <p>To make some space to seal you in.</p>
    <p>What a dizzying world around me</p>
    <p>I prayed that you would close your mouth.</p>
    <p>What an imprint sorrow leaves on you</p>
    <p>Three worlds can now scarce fill you!</p>
    <p>Can I wash those hands that touched you</p>
    <p>And forget that I had ever known you!</p>
