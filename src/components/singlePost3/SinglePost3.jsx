            Challenges are rough handcuffs
They bind you away from everything else
This is not meant for those
Who only catch fish without wetting hands!
This will need rolling up your sleeve
And tasting the sting of tears and sweat in eyes.
Then you cannot spend smiles at waves and foams
But learn to get in ease with the depth you have reached.
With fluttering wings you may dare
To dispel some darkness,a tenant for long!
Learn to live life,the inflamed way
Swooping up,leaving blazing trails.
"Ends of the world and the Great outer sea"
Were challenged and kept by Alexander the great!
Wasn't it a challenge that awakened Sidhartha
In an endless journey to find "Nirvana"
Didn't the threat of agonizing lunacy
Challenge the Guru to awaken God in stone?
When silence has  many consequences 
A challenge it is to find your voice
Dare to discern voice from noise
And go deaf and dumb at all nonsense heard!
A challenge it was for the king of our state
To give up all to keep his word
Dare a comeback from the nether world
Once every year to love his dears!
