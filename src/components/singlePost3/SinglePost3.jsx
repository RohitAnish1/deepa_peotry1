    <p>Challenges are rough handcuffs</p>
    <p>They bind you away from everything else</p>
    <p>This is not meant for those</p>
    <p>Who only catch fish without wetting hands!</p>
    <p>This will need rolling up your sleeve</p>
    <p>And tasting the sting of tears and sweat in eyes.</p>
    <p>Then you cannot spend smiles at waves and foams</p>
    <p>But learn to get in ease with the depth you have reached.</p>
    <p>With fluttering wings you may dare</p>
    <p>To dispel some darkness, a tenant for long!</p>
    <p>Learn to live life, the inflamed way</p>
    <p>Swooping up, leaving blazing trails.</p>
    <p>"Ends of the world and the Great outer sea"</p>
    <p>Were challenged and kept by Alexander the Great!</p>
    <p>Wasn't it a challenge that awakened Siddhartha</p>
    <p>In an endless journey to find "Nirvana"?</p>
    <p>Didn't the threat of agonizing lunacy</p>
    <p>Challenge the Guru to awaken God in stone?</p>
    <p>When silence has many consequences</p>
    <p>A challenge it is to find your voice</p>
    <p>Dare to discern voice from noise</p>
    <p>And go deaf and dumb at all nonsense heard!</p>
    <p>A challenge it was for the king of our state</p>
    <p>To give up all to keep his word</p>
    <p>Dare a comeback from the nether world</p>
    <p>Once every year to love his dears!</p>
