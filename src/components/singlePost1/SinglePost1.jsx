    <p>Whoever dared to pass this verdict</p>
    <p>That love can no longer exist here?</p>
    <p>Where can love move away to</p>
    <p>When we welcomed her in with lighted lamp?</p>
    <p>All those who know her will let her in</p>
    <p>At the very first knock,with folded arms!</p>
    <p>I see her at dawn,waiting at the threshold</p>
    <p>A little hesitant,for being morning's first face.</p>
    <p>Where can love leave us and go?</p>
    <p>She is here found hiding,somewhere behind the corners.</p>
    <p>Though she scares like a snake among leaves</p>
    <p>We know she has dried a lot in the sun.</p>
    <p>Love has its own morality that lust has not!</p>
    <p>It knows the trick to drench some dunes!</p>
    <p>If doubt hadn't been its alter face</p>
    <p>What a world winner it would have gone to been!</p>
    <p>There can be nothing more to hurt and hide</p>
    <p>When this sack of sweetness has burst open in you!</p>
    <p>This is a little bubble in the sea of you</p>
    <p>And you have rainbow pupils forever and for good!</p>
    <p>When all your strings are singing this tune</p>
    <p>You can join the chorus to sing the song of life.</p>
    <p>Would you care to join this swim</p>
    <p>And be a salt toy to go and fathom the sea?</p>
